Our Choice for title: "Atomic Penguin Smackdown"

## *The Idea*
Military penguins at war fighting it out on a tile map in a 1v1 turn based game.
    
    The game will have 2 players, 2 different  sizes of 16x16 and 32x32
    The game is simple, *player one will always go first*...

## Making The Game
We are using a custom engine created in another class by 2 of our memebers.
